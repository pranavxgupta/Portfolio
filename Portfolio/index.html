      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Greetings! I'm Pranav Gupta, an 20-year-old Bachelor of Computer Applications student hailing from the bustling metropolis of New Delhi. My academic journey has brought me to the prestigious Institute of Information Technology and Management, where I'm diligently honing my skills and knowledge.

      My fervor for the digital world finds its expression in the realm of web development. Crafting websites that not only function seamlessly but also captivate users with their aesthetic appeal is where I thrive. Whether it's designing an intuitive user interface or delving into the intricacies of coding, I relish every moment of this creative process.
      
      Beyond the screen and keyboard, my life takes on a harmonious rhythm with music. Exploring diverse genres, I find inspiration and solace in melodies that speak to the heart. When I'm not immersed in code or lost in a world of music, you'll often find me packing my bags for a new adventure. Traveling, for me, is a journey of self-discovery and a way to embrace the beauty of our world.
      
      This portfolio is more than just a collection of my work; it's an invitation to step into my world of web development and creativity. Join me on this exciting path where pixels and code come together to create remarkable digital experiences.</p>
